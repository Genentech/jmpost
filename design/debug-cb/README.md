# Claret Bruno Incremental Builds

To try and debug the Claret Bruno model this folder contains a series of incremental builds that will hopefully help us identify the issue.

- A - Basic model fixed effects only, strictly positive time, no censoring. No study level or arm level hierarchies.

- B - Random effects model, strictly positive time, no censoring. No study level or arm level hierarchies.
