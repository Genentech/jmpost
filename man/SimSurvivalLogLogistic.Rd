Simulate Survival Data from a Log-Logistic Proportional Hazard Model

\section{Hazard Evaluation}{


Event times are simulated by sampling a cumulative hazard limit from a \eqn{U(0, 1)} distribution
for
each subject and then counting how much hazard they've been exposed to by evaluating the
log-hazard function at a set interval. The \code{time_max} argument sets the upper bound for the
number of time points to evaluate the log-hazard function at with subjects who have not had an
event being censored at \code{time_max}. The \code{time_step} argument sets the interval at which to
evaluate the log-hazard function. Setting smaller values for \code{time_step} will increase the
precision of the simulation at the cost of increased computation time. Likewise, setting large
values for \code{time_max} will minimize the number of censored subjects at the cost of
incread computation time.
