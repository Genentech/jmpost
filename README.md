`jmpost` is currently under development and not yet in a testable state.

The scope of the package is to enable "Joint Models Predicting Overall Survival Trajectories" based on non-linear mixed effects models for the tumor size over time and correlating that with overall survival. We implement this within the package in stan and provide a flexible user interface.

Please reach out to us via issues or email (see the `DESCRIPTION` file) if you have comments or questions, thank you!
