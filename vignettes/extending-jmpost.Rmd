## Custom Link Functions

Users can defined custom link functions in several ways based upon the level of customisation
required. In order to explain this process it is first important to understand how the link
functions are implemented under the hood.

The link functions add their contribution to the likelihood function via the log-hazard function;
that is the general model is formulated as:

$$
log(h_i(t, \phi_i)) = log(h_0(t)) + X_i \beta + \alpha_1 f(t, \phi_i) + \alpha_2 g(t, \phi_i) + \dots
$$

Where:
- $X$ is the design matrix of covariates
- $\beta$ is the vector of coefficients for the covariates
- $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are the link functions
- $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are the coefficients for the link functions
- $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function
- $\phi_i$ is a vector of parameters from the longitudinal model

Each longitudinal model is responsible for defining their own implementations of the $\phi$ vector.
The interface for doing this is by providing an `enableLink` method that updates the `StanModule`
object of the model to define a Stan matrix with the name `link_function_inputs`
that contains 1 row per
patient and 1 column per $\phi$ parameter.

For reference the following is roughly the implementation for the `LongitudinalGSF` model:

```R
enableLink.LongitudinalGSF <- function(object, ...) {
  stan <- StanModule("
transformed parameters {
    matrix[Nind, 4] link_function_inputs;
    link_function_inputs[,1] = lm_gsf_psi_bsld;
    link_function_inputs[,2] = lm_gsf_psi_ks;
    link_function_inputs[,3] = lm_gsf_psi_kg;
    link_function_inputs[,4] = lm_gsf_psi_phi;
}")
    object@stan <- merge(
        object@stan,
        stan
    )
    object
}
```
That is to say the $\phi$ parameters for the `LongitudinalGSF` model are the 4 primary parameters
of the longitudinal model. If you wish to augment this with additional parameters then you can
subclass the `LongitudinalGSF` model and override the `enableLink` method to the required
additional parameters e.g.

```R
GSFextended <- setClass(
    Class = "GSFextended",
    contains = "LongitudinalGSF"
)

enableLink.GSFextended <- function(object, ...) {
  stan <- StanModule("<your stan code here>")
    object@stan <- merge(
        object@stan,
        stan
    )
    object
}
```

Next, the individual link functions are implemented as Stan functions with the following signature:

```
matrix <key>_contrib(
  matrix time,
  matrix link_function_inputs
)
```
Where:
- `<key>` is the name of the link parameter as specified in the `LinkComponent` object
- `time` is a matrix of 1 row per patient and 1 column per time point to be evaluated at for
that patient.

The `LinkComponent` object is responsible for then integrating these functions
into the final Stan model. For reference the following is roughly the implementation of the
dSLD link for the `LongitudinalRandomSlope` model:

```R
LinkComponent(
  key = "link_dsld",
  stan = StanModule("
functions {
    matrix link_dsld_contrib(
        matrix time,
        matrix link_function_inputs
    ) {
        int nrows = rows(time);
        int ncols = cols(time);
        vector[nrows] lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope = link_function_inputs[,2];
        matrix[nrows, ncols] rnd_slope_mat = rep_matrix(lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope, ncols);
        return rnd_slope_mat;
    }
}"),
  parameters = ParameterList(Parameter(name = "link_dsld", prior = prior, size = 1))
)
```

You can then pass these `LinkComponent` objects to the `link` argument of the `JointModel`
constructor to add them to the model. If you wish to add multiple link functions then you must
wrap them in a `Link()` object e.g.

```R
Link(
  LinkComponent(...),
  LinkComponent(...)
)
```

Note that there are a few families of link functions that are common across all models for example
identity, dSLD, TTG. Users can access these by simply using the inbuilt `link_identity()`,
`link_dsld()` and `link_ttg()` functions respectively.
These functions are responsible for loading the correct `LinkComponent` to implement that link for a
particular model.

If you wish to provide implementations of these
for new models then you need to provide method implementations for your model to `linkDSLD()`,
`linkIdentity()` and `linkTTG()` respectively. For example the following is the actual implementation
of the `linkDSLD` method for the `LongitudinalGSF` model which enables the use of `link_dsld()`:

```R
linkDSLD.LongitudinalGSF <- function(object, ...) {
    StanModule("
functions {
    matrix link_dsld_contrib(
        matrix time,
        matrix link_function_inputs
    ) {
        int nrows = rows(time);
        int ncols = cols(time);
        vector[nrows] lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope = link_function_inputs[,2];
        matrix[nrows, ncols] rnd_slope_mat = rep_matrix(lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope, ncols);
        return rnd_slope_mat;
    }
}")
}
```

## Formatting Stan Files

Under the hood this library works by merging multiple Stan programs together into a single
program. It does this by parsing the program to extract out each block independently.
Unfortunately, the formal Stan parser (`stanc`) provided by the Stan team
only works with complete programs whereas most of the programs within jmpost are
incomplete fragments. This package has therefore implemented its own
simple parser; as a result, in order to not have to traverse the full abstract syntax tree (AST),
a few addition constraints are made on how Stan programs can be formatted.

These additional constraints are:

- The opening to each block must start on a newline and can't have any non-whitespace character proceeding it.
- The opening to each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after the opening `{` character.
- The closing `}` character after each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after it

Valid:
```stan
data {
  int n; array[n] real x;
}       
parameters{      
  real mu; 
  real sigma;}

    model {    
x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
    }    
```

Invalid:
```stan
// non-whitespace after opening `{`
data { int n; array[n] real x; } 

parameter { real mu;      // non-whitespace after opening `{`
  real sigma;
} model {                 // non-whitespace before block name
  x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
} // some comment         // non-whitespace after closing `}`
```
