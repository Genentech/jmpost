## Formatting Stan Files

Under the hood this library works by merging multiple Stan programs together into a single
program. It does this by parsing the program to extract out each block independently.
Unfortunately, the formal Stan parser (`stanc`) provided by the Stan team
only works with complete programs whereas most of the programs within jmpost are
incomplete fragments. This package has therefore implemented its own
simple parser; as a result, in order to not have to traverse the full abstract syntax tree (AST),
a few addition constraints are made on how Stan programs can be formatted.

These additional constraints are:

- The opening to each block must start on a newline and can't have any non-whitespace character proceeding it.
- The opening to each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after the opening `{` character.
- The closing `}` character after each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after it

Valid:
```stan
data {
  int n; array[n] real x;
}       
parameters{      
  real mu; 
  real sigma;}

    model {    
x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
    }    
```

Invalid:
```stan
// non-whitespace after opening `{`
data { int n; array[n] real x; } 

parameter { real mu;      // non-whitespace after opening `{`
  real sigma;
} model {                 // non-whitespace before block name
  x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
} // some comment         // non-whitespace after closing `}`
```
