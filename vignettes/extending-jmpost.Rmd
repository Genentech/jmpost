## Custom Survival Distributions

Survival distributions in `jmpost` are specified via their contribution to the log-hazard
function. Note that at present all distributions are implemented as proportional hazards
models. This means that for any distribution that does not have the proportional hazards
property that the distribution of any specific individual subject will not be of the same family.
That is to say the distribution family e.g. "Log-Logistic" is just defining the baseline survival
distribution only.

Survival distributions are implemented as S4 classes that inherit from `SurvivalModel`.
The two main components of the `SurvivalModel` object are the `stan` and `parameters` slots.
The `parameters` slot is a `ParametersList()` object which is used to specify the prior distributions
of each parameter used by the survival distribution as well as for the design matrix coefficients.

The `stan` slot is a `StanModule()` object which needs to define the following:

1) In the `parameters` block each of the distributions parameters must be formally declared.


2) In the `transformed parameters` block there must define a vector called `pars_os` which contains one
element for each parameter used by the survival distribution.


3) In the `functions` block there must define a function called `log_h0` which returns the
log-hazard contribution. This function must have the following signature:

```stan
matrix log_h0(matrix time, vector pars_os)
```

Where:
- The return matrix must be of the same dimensionality as the `time` argument matrix where each 
element is the log-hazard contribution for the corresponding timepoint in the `time` matrix.
- The `time` matrix contains one row per unique subject and one column per timepoint for that subject
- The `pars_os` vector is as defined from (2) above and contains the parameters for that
particular distribution.

For example the following is roughly equivalent to how the Weibull distribution is implemented:
```R
SurvivalWeibullPH <- function(
    lambda = prior_gamma(2, 0.5),
    gamma = prior_gamma(2, 0.5),
    beta = prior_normal(0, 5)
) {
    stan <- StanModule("
        functions {
            matrix log_h0(matrix time, vector pars_os) {
                matrix[rows(time), cols(time)] result;
                result = log(pars_os[1]) + log(pars_os[2]) + (pars_os[2] - 1) * log(time);
                return result;
            }
        }

        parameters {
            real<lower=0> sm_weibull_ph_lambda;
            real<lower=0> sm_weibull_ph_gamma;
        }

        transformed parameters {
            vector[2] pars_os = [sm_weibull_ph_lambda, sm_weibull_ph_gamma]';
        }
    ")
    SurvivalModel(
        stan = stan,
        parameters = ParameterList(
            Parameter(name = "sm_weibull_ph_lambda", prior = lambda, size = 1),
            Parameter(name = "sm_weibull_ph_gamma", prior = gamma, size = 1),
            Parameter(name = "beta_os_cov", prior = beta, size = "p_os_cov_design")
        )
    )
}
```





## Custom Link Functions


Users can define custom link functions in several ways based upon the level of customisation
required. In order to explain this process it is first important to understand how the link
functions are implemented under the hood.

The link functions add their contribution to the likelihood function via the log-hazard function;
that is the general model is formulated as:

$$
log(h_i(t, \phi_i)) = log(h_0(t)) + X_i \beta + \alpha_1 f(t, \phi_i) + \alpha_2 g(t, \phi_i) + \dots
$$

Where:
- $X$ is the design matrix of covariates
- $\beta$ is the vector of coefficients for the covariates
- $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are the link functions
- $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are the coefficients for the link functions
- $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function
- $\phi_i$ is a vector of parameters from the longitudinal model

Each longitudinal model is responsible for defining their own implementations of the $\phi$ vector.
The interface for doing this is by providing an `enableLink` method that updates the `StanModule`
object of the model to define a Stan matrix with the name `link_function_inputs`
that contains 1 row per
patient and 1 column per $\phi$ parameter.

For reference the following is roughly the implementation for the `LongitudinalGSF` model:

```R
enableLink.LongitudinalGSF <- function(object, ...) {
  stan <- StanModule("
transformed parameters {
    matrix[n_subjects, 4] link_function_inputs;
    link_function_inputs[,1] = lm_gsf_psi_bsld;
    link_function_inputs[,2] = lm_gsf_psi_ks;
    link_function_inputs[,3] = lm_gsf_psi_kg;
    link_function_inputs[,4] = lm_gsf_psi_phi;
}")
    object@stan <- merge(
        object@stan,
        stan
    )
    object
}
```
That is to say the $\phi$ parameters for the `LongitudinalGSF` model are the 4 primary parameters
of the longitudinal model. If you wish to augment this with additional parameters then you can
subclass the `LongitudinalGSF` model and override the `enableLink` method with the required
additional parameters e.g.

```R
GSFextended <- setClass(
    Class = "GSFextended",
    contains = "LongitudinalGSF"
)

enableLink.GSFextended <- function(object, ...) {
  stan <- StanModule("<stan-code-here>")
    object@stan <- merge(
        object@stan,
        stan
    )
    object
}
```

Next, the individual link functions are implemented as Stan functions with the following signature:

```
matrix <key>_contrib(
  matrix time,
  matrix link_function_inputs
)
```
Where:
- `<key>` is the name of the link parameter as specified in the `LinkComponent` object
- `time` is a matrix of 1 row per patient and 1 column per time point to be evaluated at for
that patient.

The `LinkComponent` object is responsible for then integrating these functions
into the final Stan model. For reference the following is roughly the implementation of the
dSLD link component for the `LongitudinalRandomSlope` model:

```R
LinkComponent(
  key = "link_dsld",
  stan = StanModule("
functions {
    matrix link_dsld_contrib(
        matrix time,
        matrix link_function_inputs
    ) {
        int nrows = rows(time);
        int ncols = cols(time);
        vector[nrows] lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope = link_function_inputs[,2];
        matrix[nrows, ncols] rnd_slope_mat = rep_matrix(lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope, ncols);
        return rnd_slope_mat;
    }
}"),
  key = "link_dsld",
  prior = prior
)
```

You can then pass these `LinkComponent` objects to the `link` argument of the `JointModel`
constructor to add them to the model e.g.

```R
JointModel(
  longitudinal = LongitudinalRandomSlope(),
  survival = SurvivalExponential(),
  link = LinkComponent(...)
)
```

If you wish to add multiple link functions then you must wrap them in a `Link()` object e.g.

```R
JointModel(
  longitudinal = LongitudinalRandomSlope(),
  survival = SurvivalExponential(),
  link = Link(
    LinkComponent(...),
    LinkComponent(...)
  )
)
```

For most users the above should be sufficient for adding your own custom link functions for a
specific analysis. The following explains how to create your own generic link
functions which can be useful if you are wanting to share your code with other users or if
you are building a link function that is applicable to multiple longitudinal models and you need
polymorphism; this is only recommended for advanced users.


In order to avoid the user specify the exact model specific link component we provide
several generic functions that will return the correct link component given their
chosen link family. For example the `linkDSLD()` function will return a different implementation
of the derivative of the SLD link depending on which longitudinal model the user has provided.
These are implemented as standard S3 methods e.g.

```R
linkDSLD.LongitudinalRandomSlope <- function(prior = prior_normal(0, 2), model, ...) {
    LinkComponent(
        key = "link_dsld",
        stan = StanModule("<stan-code-here>"),
        prior = prior
    )
}
```

A key design quirk to be aware of is that these methods dispatch off of the `model` argument not
the `prior` argument. The reason for this is explained further below.


In order to simplify the end user API, the generic link functions have a default `model` argument
of `PromiseLongitudinalModel()`. This is a special object that is used to dispatch the 
`link<type>.PromiseLongitudinalModel()` method which in turn creates a
`PromiseLinkComponent` object.
The purpose of these objects is to defer the creation of the `LinkComponent` object until within
the `JointModel` constructor which will then call the `link<Type>` method again but with the correct
model object. As an example the following is the implementation of the `linkDSLD` generic. 

```R
linkDSLD <- function(prior, model = PromiseLongitudinalModel(), ...) {
    UseMethod("linkDSLD", model)
}

linkDSLD.PromiseLongitudinalModel <- function(prior = prior_normal(0, 2), model, ...) {
    PromiseLinkComponent(fun = linkDSLD, prior = prior, key = "link_dsld")
}

linkDSLD.default <- function(prior, model, ...) {
    stop(sprintf("Method `linkDSLD` is not available for `%s`", class(model)[[1]]))
}
```

For reference the `JointModel` constructor will then attempt to resolve the promise by executing
the provided function against the user provided longitudinal model object e.g.
```R
object@fun(
    prior = object@prior,
    model = <longitudinal-model>,
)
```

## Custom Simulation Functions

To assist with testing and debugging the joint models fitted via `jmpost` the `SimJointData`
constructor function is provided to generate joint data from known parameters.

### Custom Survival Simulation Functions

The survival functions are best explained by an example; the following is the implementation of
the Weibull distribution:

```R
SimSurvivalWeibullPH <- function(
    lambda,
    gamma,
    time_max = 2000,
    time_step = 1,
    lambda_censor = 1 / 3000,
    beta_cont = 0.2,
    beta_cat = c("A" = 0, "B" = -0.4, "C" = 0.2)
) {
    SimSurvival(
        time_max = time_max,
        time_step = time_step,
        lambda_censor = lambda_censor,
        beta_cont = beta_cont,
        beta_cat = beta_cat,
        loghazard = function(time) {
            log(lambda) + log(gamma) + (gamma - 1) * log(time)
        },
        name = "SimSurvivalWeibullPH"
    )
}
```

The function is a essentially a constructor function for a `SimSurvival` object. This object
needs to have the following slots defined:

- `time_max`: The maximum time to simulate up to
- `time_step`: How much of a gap to leave between time points to calculate the hazard at
- `beta_cont`: The $\beta$ coefficient for the continuous covariate (sampled from a standard normal distribution for each subject)
- `beta_cat`: The $\beta$ coefficients for the categorical covariates (evenly sampled from `names(beta_cat)` for each subject)
- `loghazard`: The log-hazard function of the baseline survival distribution
- `name`: The name of the simulation function; only used for printing purposes

For reference, the simulation functions work by sampling a cumulative hazard limit for each subject
and then sum up the subjects exposed hazard at each time point. Subjects are then regarded
as having had an event at the timepoint in which their cumulative hazard exceeds the sampled limit.
The `time_max` and `time_step` arguments are used to define the time points to calculate the hazard at.
Smaller `time_step` values will result in a more accurate approximations but will be slower to run.

### Custom Longitudinal Simulation Functions

Custom longitudinal simulation functions are slightly more involved. Essentially the user needs to
define a new class which inherits from `SimLongitudinal` and then implement the 
`sampleSubjects` and `sampleObservations` methods for the new class. The object itself should
contain all the required parameters for the model as well as a `times` slot which is a vector of
timepoints for observations to be generated at.

The `sampleSubjects` method is responsible for sampling the subject specific parameters e.g. 
individual parameters for a random effects model. The `sampleObservations` method is responsible
for calculating the tumour size at each provided time point. The following is a rough example of how
the `SimLongitudinalGSF` class is implemented:

```R
# Declare the new class
.SimLongitudinalGSF <- setClass(
    "SimLongitudinalGSF",
    contains = "SimLongitudinal",
    slots = c(
        sigma = "numeric",
        mu_s = "numeric",
        mu_g = "numeric",
        mu_b = "numeric",
        a_phi = "numeric",
        b_phi = "numeric",
        omega_b = "numeric",
        omega_s = "numeric",
        omega_g = "numeric",
        link_dsld = "numeric",
        link_ttg = "numeric",
        link_identity = "numeric"
    )
)

# Define constructor function with sensible default values
SimLongitudinalGSF <- function(
    times = c(-100, -50, 0, 50, 100, 150, 250, 350, 450, 550) / 365,
    sigma = 0.01,
    mu_s = c(0.6, 0.4),
    mu_g = c(0.25, 0.35),
    mu_b = 60,
    a_phi = c(4, 6),
    b_phi = c(4, 6),
    omega_b = 0.2,
    omega_s = 0.2,
    omega_g = 0.2,
    link_dsld = 0,
    link_ttg = 0,
    link_identity = 0
) {
    .SimLongitudinalGSF(
        times = times,
        sigma = sigma,
        mu_s = mu_s,
        mu_g = mu_g,
        mu_b = mu_b,
        a_phi = a_phi,
        b_phi = b_phi,
        omega_b = omega_b,
        omega_s = omega_s,
        omega_g = omega_g,
        link_dsld = link_dsld,
        link_ttg = link_ttg,
        link_identity = link_identity
    )
}

sampleSubjects.SimLongitudinalGSF <- function(object, subjects_df) {
    res <- subjects_df |>
        dplyr::mutate(study_idx = as.numeric(.data$study)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(arm_idx = as.numeric(.data$arm)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(psi_b = stats::rlnorm(dplyr::n(), log(object@mu_b[.data$study_idx]), object@omega_b)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(psi_s = stats::rlnorm(dplyr::n(), log(object@mu_s[.data$arm_idx]), object@omega_s)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(psi_g = stats::rlnorm(dplyr::n(), log(object@mu_g[.data$arm_idx]), object@omega_g)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(psi_phi = stats::rbeta(dplyr::n(), object@a_phi[.data$arm_idx], object@b_phi[.data$arm_idx]))
    res[, c("pt", "arm", "study", "psi_b", "psi_s", "psi_g", "psi_phi")]
}

sampleObservations.SimLongitudinalGSF <- function(object, times_df) {
    times_df |>
        dplyr::mutate(mu_sld = gsf_sld(.data$time, .data$psi_b, .data$psi_s, .data$psi_g, .data$psi_phi)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(dsld = gsf_dsld(.data$time, .data$psi_b, .data$psi_s, .data$psi_g, .data$psi_phi)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(ttg = gsf_ttg(.data$time, .data$psi_b, .data$psi_s, .data$psi_g, .data$psi_phi)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(sld = stats::rnorm(dplyr::n(), .data$mu_sld, .data$mu_sld * object@sigma)) |>
        dplyr::mutate(
            log_haz_link =
                (object@link_dsld * .data$dsld) +
                (object@link_ttg * .data$ttg) +
                (object@link_identity * .data$mu_sld)
        )
}
```


The `subjects_df` argument to the `sampleSubjects` method is a `data.frame` with the following columns:

- `pt`: The subject identifier
- `arm`: The treatment arm that the subject belongs to
- `study`: The study that the subject belongs to

Of note is that this dataset contains one row per subject. The return value must be a `data.frame` with the
same number of rows as the input dataset as well as the `pt`, `arm` and `study` columns. The remaining
columns are the subject specific parameters and can have any arbitrary name.

The `times_df` argument to the `sampleObservations` method is the same `data.frame` that was
generated in the `sampleSubjects` method but duplicated once per required timepoint with an
additional `time` column that contains said timepoint. The return value must be a `data.frame` with
the same number of rows as the input dataset as well as the original columns
`pt`, `arm`, `study` and `time`.
In addition to the original columns the function must also define the following new columns:

- `sld`: The tumour size at the given timepoint
- `log_haz_link`: The contribution to the hazard function at that timepoint (set this to 0 if not
defining a link function)

## Formatting Stan Files

Under the hood this library works by merging multiple Stan programs together into a single
program. It does this by parsing the program to extract out each block independently.
Unfortunately, the formal Stan parser (`stanc`) provided by the Stan team
only works with complete programs whereas most of the programs within `jmpost` are
incomplete fragments. This package has therefore implemented its own
simple parser; as a result, in order to not have to traverse the full abstract syntax tree (AST),
a few addition constraints are made on how Stan programs can be formatted.

These additional constraints are:

- The opening to each block must start on a newline and can't have any non-whitespace character proceeding it.
- The opening to each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after the opening `{` character.
- The closing `}` character after each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after it

Valid:
```stan
data {
  int n; array[n] real x;
}       
parameters{      
  real mu; 
  real sigma;}

    model {    
x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
    }    
```

Invalid:
```stan
// non-whitespace after opening `{`
data { int n; array[n] real x; } 

parameter { real mu;      // non-whitespace after opening `{`
  real sigma;
} model {                 // non-whitespace before block name
  x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
} // some comment         // non-whitespace after closing `}`
```

## Stan Data Objects

When writing your own Stan code to extend `jmpost` it is important to note that
many different data objects have already been defined in the `data` block of the
base Stan template. This section outlines the different data objects that are
made available to user. Note that some objects are only made available if
the corresponding model is used; for example death times are only available if
the user specifies a `SurvivalModel` object to `JointModel()`.

### Global Data Objects

**Number of unique subjects**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_subjects;
```

**Number of unique studies**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_studies;
```

**Number of unique treatment arms**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_arms;
```

**Study index for each subject**
```stan
array[n_subjects] int<lower=1,upper=n_studies> subject_study_index;
```
- Note that this is sorted based upon the subject's factor level within the R `data.frame`.
For example lets say subject `"A"` has a factor level of 15 and that their corresponding
study value has a factor level of 2 then `subject_study_index[15]` will be 2.

**Treatment arm index for each subject**
```stan
  array[n_subjects] int<lower=1,upper=n_arms> subject_arm_index;
```
- A mirror of `subject_study_index` but for the treatment arm.


### Survival Data Objects


**Number of events**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_subject_event;
```

**Event/Censor Times**
```stan
vector[n_subjects] event_times;
```
- Ordered by patient factor level

**Event Index**
```stan
array[n_subject_event] int subject_event_index;
```
- Is the index into `event_times` to identify which times are an event. The rest are censored.


**Number of covariates for the survival model**
```stan
int<lower=0> p_os_cov_design;
```
- Note that this does not include an intercept term, which would conflict with the baseline distribution parameters.

**Covariate design matrix for the survival model**
```stan
matrix[n_subjects, p_os_cov_design] os_cov_design;
```
- Note that this does not include an intercept term, which would conflict with the baseline distribution parameters.


**Time >0 flag**
```stan
array[rows(event_times)] int time_positive_flag;
```

**Number of times >0**
```stan
int n_times_positive;
```

**Positive time index**
```stan
array[n_times_positive] int time_positive_index
```


**Gaussian Quadrature Integration Parameters**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_nodes;
vector[n_nodes] nodes;
vector<lower=0, upper=1>[n_nodes] weights;
```
- These are the nodes and weights for the Gaussian quadrature integration.


### Longitudinal Data Objects

**Total number of tumour assessments**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_tumour_all;
```

**Number of tumour assessments above LLoQ (Lower Limit of Quantification)**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_tumour_obs;
```

**Number of tumour assessments below LLoQ (Lower Limit of Quantification)**
```stan
int<lower=0> n_tumour_cens;
```

**Tumour assessments values**
```stan
vector[n_tumour_all] tumour_value;
```

**Tumour assessments time points**
```stan
vector[n_tumour_all] tumour_time;
```

**LLoQ threshold**
```stan
real tumour_value_lloq;
```

**Individual tumour assessment index**
```stan
array[n_tumour_all] int subject_tumour_index;
```
- That is if tumour assessment 1 belongs to the patient with factor level 3 then
`subject_tumour_index[1]` will be 3.


**Tumour assessment index for observations above LLoQ (Lower Limit of Quantification)**
```stan
array[n_tumour_obs] int subject_tumour_index_obs;
```
- For example if only tumour assessments 3 and 5 were above the LLoQ then
`subject_tumour_index_obs` will be `[3, 5]`.

**Tumour assessment index for observations below LLoQ (Lower Limit of Quantification)**
```stan
array[n_tumour_cens] int subject_tumour_index_cens;
```
- For example if only tumour assessments 1 and 2 were below the LLoQ then
`subject_tumour_index_obs` will be `[1, 2]`.


**Sparse matrix components for patient indexes of the tumour assessments**
```stan
array [3] int<lower=0> n_mat_inds_all_y;
vector[n_mat_inds_all_y[1]] w_mat_inds_all_y;
array[n_mat_inds_all_y[2]] int v_mat_inds_all_y;
array[n_mat_inds_all_y[3]] int u_mat_inds_all_y;
```
- This is the sparse matrix representation of the binary matrix that has one row per patient and one column per tumour assessment. That is, for row 3 of this matrix all columns that have an entry of 1 indicate that the corresponding entry in `tumour_value` belongs to the patient with factor level 3. This matrix is primarily used to calculate the sum
of log-likelihood for all tumour assessments per patient in an efficient way.
- See [the Stan CSR documentation](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/sparse_matrix_operations.html#CSR) for more information on the sparse matrix representation.


**Sparse matrix components for patient indexes of the tumour assessments above the LLoQ**
```stan
array [3] int<lower=1> n_mat_inds_obs_y;
vector[n_mat_inds_obs_y[1]] w_mat_inds_obs_y;
array[n_mat_inds_obs_y[2]] int v_mat_inds_obs_y;
array[n_mat_inds_obs_y[3]] int u_mat_inds_obs_y;
```
- Same as above but only for the tumour assessments above the LLoQ.

**Sparse matrix components for patient indexes of the tumour assessments below the LLoQ**
```stan
array [3] int<lower=0> n_mat_inds_cens_y;
vector[n_mat_inds_cens_y[1]] w_mat_inds_cens_y;
array[n_mat_inds_cens_y[2]] int v_mat_inds_cens_y;
array[n_mat_inds_cens_y[3]] int u_mat_inds_cens_y;
```
- Same as above but only for the tumour assessments below the LLoQ.


### Global Quantity Data Objects


**Number of quantities to be generated**
```stan
int <lower=1> gq_n_quant;
```

**Assessment time for that the corresponding quantity should be generated at**
```stan
vector[gq_n_quant] gq_times;
```

**Patient index for each quantity**
```stan
array[gq_n_quant] int<lower=1, upper=n_subjects> gq_pt_index;
```
- `GridFixed()` / `GridGrouped()` / `GridObserved()` / `GridManual()` only


### Survival Quantity Data Objects
