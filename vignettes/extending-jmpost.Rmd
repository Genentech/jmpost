## Custom Link Functions


Users can define custom link functions in several ways based upon the level of customisation
required. In order to explain this process it is first important to understand how the link
functions are implemented under the hood.

The link functions add their contribution to the likelihood function via the log-hazard function;
that is the general model is formulated as:

$$
log(h_i(t, \phi_i)) = log(h_0(t)) + X_i \beta + \alpha_1 f(t, \phi_i) + \alpha_2 g(t, \phi_i) + \dots
$$

Where:
- $X$ is the design matrix of covariates
- $\beta$ is the vector of coefficients for the covariates
- $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ are the link functions
- $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ are the coefficients for the link functions
- $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function
- $\phi_i$ is a vector of parameters from the longitudinal model

Each longitudinal model is responsible for defining their own implementations of the $\phi$ vector.
The interface for doing this is by providing an `enableLink` method that updates the `StanModule`
object of the model to define a Stan matrix with the name `link_function_inputs`
that contains 1 row per
patient and 1 column per $\phi$ parameter.

For reference the following is roughly the implementation for the `LongitudinalGSF` model:

```R
enableLink.LongitudinalGSF <- function(object, ...) {
  stan <- StanModule("
transformed parameters {
    matrix[Nind, 4] link_function_inputs;
    link_function_inputs[,1] = lm_gsf_psi_bsld;
    link_function_inputs[,2] = lm_gsf_psi_ks;
    link_function_inputs[,3] = lm_gsf_psi_kg;
    link_function_inputs[,4] = lm_gsf_psi_phi;
}")
    object@stan <- merge(
        object@stan,
        stan
    )
    object
}
```
That is to say the $\phi$ parameters for the `LongitudinalGSF` model are the 4 primary parameters
of the longitudinal model. If you wish to augment this with additional parameters then you can
subclass the `LongitudinalGSF` model and override the `enableLink` method to the required
additional parameters e.g.

```R
GSFextended <- setClass(
    Class = "GSFextended",
    contains = "LongitudinalGSF"
)

enableLink.GSFextended <- function(object, ...) {
  stan <- StanModule("<your stan code here>")
    object@stan <- merge(
        object@stan,
        stan
    )
    object
}
```

Next, the individual link functions are implemented as Stan functions with the following signature:

```
matrix <key>_contrib(
  matrix time,
  matrix link_function_inputs
)
```
Where:
- `<key>` is the name of the link parameter as specified in the `LinkComponent` object
- `time` is a matrix of 1 row per patient and 1 column per time point to be evaluated at for
that patient.

The `LinkComponent` object is responsible for then integrating these functions
into the final Stan model. For reference the following is roughly the implementation of the
dSLD link for the `LongitudinalRandomSlope` model:

```R
LinkComponent(
  key = "link_dsld",
  stan = StanModule("
functions {
    matrix link_dsld_contrib(
        matrix time,
        matrix link_function_inputs
    ) {
        int nrows = rows(time);
        int ncols = cols(time);
        vector[nrows] lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope = link_function_inputs[,2];
        matrix[nrows, ncols] rnd_slope_mat = rep_matrix(lm_rs_ind_rnd_slope, ncols);
        return rnd_slope_mat;
    }
}"),
  parameters = ParameterList(Parameter(name = "link_dsld", prior = prior, size = 1))
)
```

You can then pass these `LinkComponent` objects to the `link` argument of the `JointModel`
constructor to add them to the model. If you wish to add multiple link functions then you must
wrap them in a `Link()` object e.g.

```R
Link(
  LinkComponent(...),
  LinkComponent(...)
)
```

Note that there are a few families of link functions that are common across all models for example
identity, dSLD, TTG. Users can access these by simply using the inbuilt `link_identity()`,
`link_dsld()` and `link_ttg()` functions respectively.

These functions are responsible for loading the correct `LinkComponent` to
implement that link for a particular model.
That is if the user wants to specify both the
TTG link and the dSLD for a model then they can do so via:

```R
JointModel(
  ...,
  link = Link(
    link_dsld(),
    link_ttg()
  )
) 
```

Under the hood these link-family functions work by defining a `LinkComponent` object
that specifies a method that will return a `StanModule` object instead of specifying
the `StanModule` object directly. This method will then be called by the `JointModel` constructor
with the `LongitudinalModel` object as its first argument. This way each longitudinal model is 
able to specify their own implementation for the given link family. The following is a rough outline
for how this works for the `link_dsld()` function and the `LongitudinalGSF` model:

```R
link_dsld <- function() {
  LinkComponent(
    key = "link_dsld",
    stan = linkDSLD,
    parameters = ParameterList(Parameter(name = "link_dsld", prior = prior, size = 1))
  )
}

linkDSLD.LongitudinalGSF <- function(object, ...) {
  StanModule("<stan code for GSF dSLD link>")
}
```

This is to say that if you wish to overwrite a model implementation for an existing link family or
provide an implementation for a new model then you can do so by defining/overwriting the relevant
methods. For clarity the underlying methods are `linkDSLD`, `linkIdentity` and `linkTTG`
respectively.


## Formatting Stan Files

Under the hood this library works by merging multiple Stan programs together into a single
program. It does this by parsing the program to extract out each block independently.
Unfortunately, the formal Stan parser (`stanc`) provided by the Stan team
only works with complete programs whereas most of the programs within `jmpost` are
incomplete fragments. This package has therefore implemented its own
simple parser; as a result, in order to not have to traverse the full abstract syntax tree (AST),
a few addition constraints are made on how Stan programs can be formatted.

These additional constraints are:

- The opening to each block must start on a newline and can't have any non-whitespace character proceeding it.
- The opening to each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after the opening `{` character.
- The closing `}` character after each block cannot have any non-whitespace characters after it

Valid:
```stan
data {
  int n; array[n] real x;
}       
parameters{      
  real mu; 
  real sigma;}

    model {    
x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
    }    
```

Invalid:
```stan
// non-whitespace after opening `{`
data { int n; array[n] real x; } 

parameter { real mu;      // non-whitespace after opening `{`
  real sigma;
} model {                 // non-whitespace before block name
  x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
} // some comment         // non-whitespace after closing `}`
```

## Stan Data Objects

When writing your own Stan code to extend `jmpost` it is important to note that
many different data objects have already been defined in the `data` block of the
base Stan template. This section outlines the different data objects that are
made available to user. Note that some objects are only made available if
the corresponding model is used; for example death times are only available if
the user specifies a `SurvivalModel` object to `JointModel()`.

### Global Data Objects

**Number of unique subjects**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_subjects;
```

**Number of unique studies**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_studies;
```

**Number of unique treatment arms**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_arms;
```

**Study index for each patient**
```stan
array[n_subjects] int<lower=1,upper=n_studies> pt_study_index;
```
- Note that this is sorted based upon the patients factor level within the R `data.frame`.
For example lets say patient `"A"` has a factor level of 15 and that their corresponding
study value has a factor level of 2 then `pt_study_index[15]` will be 2.

**Treatment arm index for each patient**
```stan
  array[n_subjects] int<lower=1,upper=n_arms> pt_arm_index;
```
- A mirror of `pt_study_index` but for the treatment arm.


### Survival Data Objects


**Number of events**
```stan
int<lower=1> Nind_dead;
```

**Event/Censor Times**
```stan
vector[n_subjects] Times;
```
- Ordered by patient factor level

**Event Index**
```stan
array[Nind_dead] int dead_ind_index;
```
- Is the index into `Times` to identify which times are an event. The rest are censored.


**Number of covariates for the survival model**
```stan
int<lower=0> p_os_cov_design;
```
- Note that this does not include the intercept term.

**Covariate design matrix for the survival model**
```stan
matrix[Nind, p_os_cov_design] os_cov_design;
```
- Note that this does not include the intercept term.


**Time >0 flag**
```stan
array[rows(Times)] int time_positive;
```

**Number of times >0**
```stan
int n_positive;
```

**Positive time index**
```stan
array[n_positive] int time_positive_index
```


**Gaussian Quadrature Integration Parameters**
```stan
int<lower=1> n_nodes;
vector[n_nodes] nodes;
vector<lower=0, upper=1>[n_nodes] weights;
```
- These are the nodes and weights for the Gaussian quadrature integration.


### Longitudinal Data Objects

**Total number of tumour assessments**
```stan
int<lower=1> Nta_total;
```

**Number of tumour assessments above LLoQ**
```stan
int<lower=1> Nta_obs_y;
```

**Number of tumour assessments below LLoQ**
```stan
int<lower=0> Nta_cens_y;
```

**Tumour assessments values**
```stan
vector[Nta_total] Yobs;
```

**Tumour assessments time points**
```stan
vector[Nta_total] Tobs;
```

**LLoQ threshold**
```stan
real Ythreshold;
```

**Individual tumour assessment index**
```stan
array[Nta_total] int ind_index;
```
- That is if tumour assessment 1 belongs to the patient with factor level 3 then
`ind_index[1]` will be 3.


**Tumour assessment index for observations above LLoQ**
```stan
array[Nta_obs_y] int obs_y_index;
```
- For example if only tumour assessments 3 and 5 were above the LLoQ then
`obs_y_index` will be `[3, 5]`.

**Tumour assessment index for observations below LLoQ**
```stan
array[Nta_cens_y] int cens_y_index;
```
- For example if only tumour assessments 1 and 2 were below the LLoQ then
`obs_y_index` will be `[1, 2]`.


**Sparse matrix components for patient indexes of the tumour assessments**
```stan
array [3] int<lower=0> n_mat_inds_all_y;
vector[n_mat_inds_all_y[1]] w_mat_inds_all_y;
array[n_mat_inds_all_y[2]] int v_mat_inds_all_y;
array[n_mat_inds_all_y[3]] int u_mat_inds_all_y;
```
- This is the sparse matrix representation of the binary matrix that has one row per patient and one column per tumour assessment. That is, for row 3 of this matrix all columns that have an entry of 1 indicate that the corresponding entry in `Yobs` belongs to the patient with factor level 3. This matrix is primarily used to calculate the sum
of log-likelihood for all tumour assessments per patient in an efficient way.
- See [the Stan CSR documentation](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/sparse_matrix_operations.html#CSR) for more information on the sparse matrix representation.


**Sparse matrix components for patient indexes of the tumour assessments above the LLoQ**
```stan
array [3] int<lower=1> n_mat_inds_obs_y;
vector[n_mat_inds_obs_y[1]] w_mat_inds_obs_y;
array[n_mat_inds_obs_y[2]] int v_mat_inds_obs_y;
array[n_mat_inds_obs_y[3]] int u_mat_inds_obs_y;
```
- Same as above but only for the tumour assessments above the LLoQ.

**Sparse matrix components for patient indexes of the tumour assessments below the LLoQ**
```stan
array [3] int<lower=0> n_mat_inds_cens_y;
vector[n_mat_inds_cens_y[1]] w_mat_inds_cens_y;
array[n_mat_inds_cens_y[2]] int v_mat_inds_cens_y;
array[n_mat_inds_cens_y[3]] int u_mat_inds_cens_y;
```
- Same as above but only for the tumour assessments below the LLoQ.
