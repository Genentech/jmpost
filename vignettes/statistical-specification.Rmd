# Longitudinal Model Specification


## Generalized Stein-Fojo (GSF) Model

$$
\begin{align*}
y_{ij} &\sim \mathcal{N}(SLD_{ij}, SLD_{ij}^2 \sigma^2) \\ \\
SLD_{ij} &=b_{i}
\left[
    \phi_i e^{-s_{i}t_{ij}}+
    (1-\phi_{i}) e^ {g_{i}t_{ij}}
\right] \\ \\
b_i &\sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu_{bl(i)}, \omega_b) \\
s_i &\sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu_{sk(i)}, \omega_s) \\
g_i &\sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu_{gk(i)}, \omega_g) \\
\phi &\sim \text{Beta}(a_{\phi k(i)}, b_{\phi k(i)})
\end{align*}
$$

Where:

* $i$ is the subject index
* $j$ is the visit index
* $y_{ij}$ is the observed tumour measurements
* $SLD_{ij}$ is the expected sum of longest diameter for subject $i$ at time point $j$
* $t_{ij}$ is the time since first treatment for subject $i$ at visit $j$
* $b_i$ is the subject baseline SLD measurement
* $s_i$ is the subject kinetics shrinkage parameter
* $g_i$ is the subject kinetics tumour growth parameter
* $\phi_i$ is the subject proportion of cells affected by the treatment
* $k(i)$ is the treatment arm index for subject $i$
* $l(i)$ is the study index for subject $i$
* $\mu_{\theta k(i)}$ is the population mean for parameter $\theta$ in group $k(i)$
* $\omega_{\theta}$ is the population parameter for parameter $\theta$.
* $\eta_{\theta i}$ is a random effects offset on parameter $\theta$ for subject $i$

## Brier Score

The Brier Score is used to measure a models predictive performance. In the case of Survival Models
it is the weighted squared difference between whether a subject died within a given time interval
and the models estimated probability of them dying within said interval. Within `jmpost` the
following formula (as described in @blanche2015) has been implemented:

$$
\hat{BS}(t) =  \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{W}_i(t) \Big(D_i(t) - \pi_i(t)  \Big)^2
$$

$$
\hat{W}_i(t) = 
    \frac{\mathbb{1}_{(T_i \gt t)}}{\hat{G}(t)} + 
    \frac{\mathbb{1}_{(T_i \le t)} \cdot \Delta_i}{\hat{G}(T_i)}
$$

Where:

- $T_i$ is the observed event/censor time for subject $i$
- $\Delta_i$ is the event indicator which is 1 if $T_i$ is an event and 0 if $T_i$ is censored
- $\mathbb{1}_{(.)}$ is the indicator which is 1 if ${(.)}$ is true else 0
- $D_i(t)$ is the event indicator function for subject $i$ e.g. $D_i(t) = \mathbb{1}_{(T_i \lt t,\ \delta_i = 1)}$
- $\pi_i(t)$ is a model predicted probability of subject $i$ dying before time $t$
- $\hat{G}(u)$ is the Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival function of the censoring time at $u$


Note that by default $\hat{G}(T_i)$ is estimated by $\hat{G}(T_i-)$ and that in the case of ties
event times are always considered to have occurred before censored times (this is in contrast to
`survival::survfit` which regards censored times as coming before event times when estimating
the censoring distribution). Both of these default options can be changed if required.
